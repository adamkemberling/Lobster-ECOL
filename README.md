# Lobster-ECOL

This is the ecological data processing code for the Lobster ecology project.

Code covers the acquisition and data processing of physical and ecological datasets at the following scales and from the following sources:


## Northeast US Shelf-wide Scale:

#### Gulf Stream Position
 > Source: Ecodata


#### Sea Surface Temperature
 1. SST Anomalies
 2. Days over 20 C
 3. Days within 12-18 C

> Source: OISST

#### Bottom Temperature
 1. BT Anomalies
 2. Days over 20 C
 3. Days within 12-18 C 
 
> Source: State of the ecosystem / ecodata

#### Salinity

> Only if requested
> Source: Glorys or Du Pontavice

#### Currents
1. Relative inflow of GS vs. Scotian Shelf water at NE Channel 

> Source: ecodata::slopewater

## At Gulf of Maine, SNE & GB Scale:

#### Sea Surface Temperature
 1. SST Anomalies   
 2. Days over 20 C
 3. Days within 12-18 C
 
> Source: OISST

#### Bottom Temperature
 1. BT Anomalies
 2. Days over 20 C
 3. Days within 12-18 C
 
 > Source: State of the ecosystem / ecodata

#### Primary Productivity
 1. Annual PAR and photosynthetic efficiency 

> Source: ecodata

#### Zooplankton
 1. Annual abundance by taxa

> Source: Ecodata?

#### Predator Indices

> Sources: NEFSC & ME/NH Survey

#### Predator exploitation rate
 1. Based on rate as calculated in the 2020 lobster stock assessment as the annual catch of lobster divided by the estimate of population abundance
